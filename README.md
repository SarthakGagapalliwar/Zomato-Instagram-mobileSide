# Zomato-Instagram-mobileSide

A mobile-first food discovery experience inspired by Instagram reels. The project pairs a React/Vite frontend with an Express + MongoDB backend so diners can explore short-form food videos, like/save dishes, and connect with food partners who manage their own storefront reels.

### Key technologies

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, React Router, Axios, mobile-first CSS.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express 5, Mongoose, Multer (in-memory uploads), JWT with httpOnly cookies, ImageKit SDK.
- **Database & storage:** MongoDB for persistence, ImageKit for video hosting.

## ‚ú® Features at a glance

- Dual-account onboarding for diners (users) and food partners.
- Secure authentication with hashed passwords and JWT cookies.
- Infinite-style reel feed with auto-playing food videos, like/save counters, and partner deep-links.
- Saved items view that mirrors Instagram collections.
- Food partner profile page that aggregates their uploads.
- Protected APIs that infer the active account (user or partner) for likes/saves.
- Food partner upload workflow that stores video files via ImageKit.

## üöÄ Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ‚â• 18
- npm ‚â• 9
- MongoDB instance (local or hosted)
- ImageKit account for media hosting

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```powershell
cd <your-workspace>
git clone https://github.com/SarthakGagapalliwar/Zomato-Instagram-mobileSide.git
cd Zomato-Instagram-mobileSide

# Backend deps
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend deps
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure backend environment

Create `backend/.env` with the following keys:

```
PORT=3000                    # Optional; defaults to 3000 in server.js
MONGODB_URL=<your Mongo connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<random string for signing tokens>
IMAGE_PUBLIC_KEY=<ImageKit public API key>
IMAGE_PRIVATE_KEY=<ImageKit private API key>
IMAGE_URL_ENDPOINT=<ImageKit URL endpoint>
```

> The backend issues JWTs via httpOnly cookies. When serving the frontend from another origin, ensure `origin` in `src/app.js` matches the Vite dev server (default `http://localhost:5173`).

### 3. Run the services

Start the API (from `backend/`):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Launch the frontend (from `frontend/`):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server prints a local URL (default `http://localhost:5173`). The Express API listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üß™ Testing & quality

- No automated tests ship with this repository yet (`npm test` placeholders are present). Consider adding Jest/Vitest suites for controllers and React hooks.
- ESLint is configured for the frontend (`npm run lint`).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap ideas

- Add optimistic UI for likes/saves when requests fail.
- Support comments and social sharing.
- Provide partner analytics (view counts, engagement rates).
- Add deployment recipes (Docker, CI/CD) and environment-specific configs.

## ü§ù Contributing
